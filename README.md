The Preclinical Image DAtaset Repository (PIDAR) is a public repository of metadata information of preclinical image datasets from any imaging modality associated to peer-review publications. The imaging metadata are organized as “collections” defined by a common disease, image modality or sub type (MRI, CT, PET, etc) or research focus. An emphasis is made to provide supporting data related to the images such as outcomes, treatment details, genomics and expert analyses. The main aim of this repository is to make the dataset FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable inside the scientific community. All the dataset are supposed to be accessible through a license.
